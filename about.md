## About
This place is meant to be a repository of serendipitous thoughts, a place to elaborate and share the ideas I have in mind at a given point in time. In ancient Greece it was used to define "hypomnemata" as the activity of recording thoughts, experiences and curiosities for later synthesis and reflection. Therefore, what you will find here are not absolute unchangable truths, but an evolution of views on a variety of topics.

In short, I am a student of Economics living in Turin, Italy. Although I believe the way I write is a bit cringe, I whish you could find the topics trated here as helpful and interesting as they are for me. The areas that this site will cover are mainly:
- Mathematics
- Economics and Finance
- Computer Science
- Physics
- Philosophy
- Cognitive Sciences
