## There are many cool things out there to learn
Many things occurred since [my last post](/articles/article00003), where I posted a raw draft of my bachelor dissertation and a random example of manim animation I was working on. In this post I will try to recap what I have been working on in the last 9 months and try to establish plans for the future.

I graduated in economics and, to make a long story short, I can say it was a nice experience overall, in particular the last year was full of interesting subjects and lead me to the discovery of what is called quantitative or mathematical finance.

I applied to a master in quantitative finance but got rejected probably due to the fact that I didn't have very high grades. Obviously I was a bit disappointed and upset about not having fully committed in my studies until last year, but luckily enough, this was one of those times in which missing a train leads to the opportunity leading to a better destination in the next one. I discovered an alternative master program in stochastics and data science, which I think is the best possible path I could pursue for my goal of becoming a good quant. So, I applied, did the admission test and finally got admitted.

Well this sounds pretty straightforward and easy, the challenge was and still is to get acquainted with the math I didn't appreciate as an undergraduate. I have chosen the hardest path and it confirmed to be so, but I also know that soon or late I will reap the fruits of such a choice.

Apart from university I kept inquiring on different subjects here and there, however with time I notice that the more new interesting things I encounter, the more I feel like a poor little ant collecting crumbs of knowledge. I kept using neovim and I recently installed linux which I am trying to shape for an enjoyable workflow that suits my preferences. Finally, since I started my master I have been trying to fill the gaps in my mathematical preparation as much as possible every day. I still have a lot of progress to do and there are some things that I still have to figure out, but I reserve these kind of reflections for another time.

I don't want to be too much bothering, that is enough romance for today, let's talk about plans for the future. As I mentioned, my main current goal is to become a competent quant (although I do not have a clear idea yet about which area I'd like to specialize in). What does it imply? Although mine may be an extreme view or position, I really think that becoming a quant involes a perpetual holistic process of learning. We make decisions based on the knowledge we possess (our own $\sigma$-algebra). Any little piece of additional information, even if not apparently strictly related with one's main mansion, can lead to an edge or a completely different result in some given circumstances. I said apparently because the connection between ideas and events is limited by the extent our own ignorance, for example, if I may bet on the outcome of the toss of a coin after it has been flipped, I'd be in a much better position if I was able to see the upper face of the coin. Although this is not very feasible in everyday life, the point is that being able to make particular observations that no one else sees can be extremely valuable, and this is a kind of vision that mathematics can foster. Keeping up with the analogy, I may not be able to see the coin directly, but if I simply took a look from below the table I may notice that the table is transparent and I could see the downward face and infer the result from that. Now, it may also be that the coin is rigged and has the same face on both sides, but in such a case I may be just "unlucky" or naive if I knew that the one who threw the coin is a famous swindler. Related to this idea, there is a book by [Bruno de Finetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_de_Finetti) titled "Il saper vedere in matematica", which is in the endless list of books I'd like to read and digest.

To sum up:
$$\mathbb{K}\text{nowledge}\stackrel{n\to \infty}{\longrightarrow}\infty$$
(gently borrowed from https://thebrightsideofmathematics.com/).

So, what should I do to become a good quant? The following is a non-exhaustive list (more or less in order of relevance) of the skills that a good quant should have as far as I know at the time of writing this:
- Maths: calculus, linear algebra, real and functional analysis, modern probability theory, mathematical statistics (and econometrics), stochastic calculus, partial and stochastic differential equations, time series analysis and any additional branch of mathematics is very welcome (group theory, complex analysis, abstract algebra and so on).
- Computer science: low level programming in particular. Why? Think of the driver of a car, the one who knows how the car works under the hood, compared with the one who just drives, has greater chances to solve unexpected problems. Also algorithms (especially important for high frequency trading), data structures and machine learning.
- Finance and economics: there are so many areas in economics, many of which run on idealized simplifications of reality, which are of course useful in many ways but also limited for real applications. The ones of most interest for a quant are of course knowledge of the different financial intruments, asset pricing, portfolio theory and risk management. This is probably the easiest subject to learn, and probably the easiest to be fooled by because of the reason I mentioned before, but there are valuable ideas here and there that can offer valuable insights. For instance, concepts such as opportunity cost, diminishing returns and comparative advantage are well beyond the scope of economics itself. Probably the only two subjects worth really knowing well here are history of economics and monetary economics. Honorable mentions: micro and macro economics, international economics, expected utility theory/decision theory/behavioral economics.
- Communication: being able to explain complex concepts in a clear and well organized way may be one of the hardest yet important things to do, especially in technical fields where hard skills and backgrounds are so diversified.
_"Lagrange believed that a mathematician had not thoroughly understood his own work till he has made it so clear that he can go out and explain it effectively to the first man he meets on the street."_ - (in "Men of mathematics")

But this goes far beyond work, as Aristotle said, man is a social animal. Almost everything we do boilds down to some kind of interaction with others and the better we can interact, the more enjoyable life will be.
- Culture: literally anything, useful or useless as it may be. Anything can lead to important insights and new ideas. For example, Kolmogorov founded modern probability theory by "simply" relying on measure theory initially constructed by Henri Lebesgue to solve problems related to harmonic analysis. Based on the 1900 PhD dissertation of Louis Bachelier, which was almost neglected back at that time, and some other works, Black, Scholes and Merton constructed what is the most famous model that has revolutionized finance. The examples can go on, but the idea is that what really makes the difference is, again, to be able to see what other's can't by realying on the works of others, culture and intuition.

I believe there is no such thing as intelligence, there is just culture, familiarity and experience with a given subject. If you practice solving many increasinly difficult problems, at some point you will be able to solve more and more challenging ones. Many programmers say that the only way to become good at programming is by looking and writing a lot of code. Writers say the only way to become good at writing is by writing a lot, and the same principles apply regardless of the field, wether it is music, chess, trading or acting. There are plenty of books nowadays related to the concept of [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory): "Mastery", "Talent is Overrated", "So good they can't ignore you", "Grit" and so on.

These are the areas I will keep working on.

_"Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives. Choice, not chance, determines your destiny."_

Lastly, here is the final version of my bachelor dissertation if you are curious to see the end result.
