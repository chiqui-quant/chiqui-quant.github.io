## Quotes
As Miguel de Cervantes said: "Un proverbio es una frase corta basada en una larga experiencia.", which means "a proverb is a short phrase based on a large experience". The following is a collection of quotes that inspire me.

### Leonardo da Vinci
> Iron rusts from disuse, water loses its purity from stagnation, even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.

> Learning never exausts the mind.

> Just as food eaten without appetite is a tedious nourishment, so does study without zeal damage the memory by not assimilating what it absorbs.

> Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.
